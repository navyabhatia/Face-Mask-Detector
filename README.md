## Face-Mask-Detector

# Introduction
During pandemic COVID-19, WHO has made compulsory to wear masks protect against this deadly virus.
Therefore Built a real-time system to detect whether the person on the webcam is wearing a mask or not.

# Tools Used
I have trained this face mask detector model using Python,Keras and OpenCV.

# Dataset
The dataset I am  working on consists of 1376 images with 690 images containing images of people wearing masks and 686 images with people without masks.
I have trained the model using Keras with network architecture. Training the model is the first part of this project and testing using webcam using OpenCV is the second part.
